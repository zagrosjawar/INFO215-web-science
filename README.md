## Welcome to my INFO215-web-science GitHub repository!

Here you'll find my assignments/projects, and resources from web science course at the University of Bergen. Throughout the course, I gained extensive knowledge of Web Science, including web data crawling, analysis, and visualization using Python and its libraries such as Spacy, Django, and Scrapy.

I also explored exciting topics such as social web mining, utilizing APIs like GitHub API and Wikipedia API to extract valuable insights from social web data.
