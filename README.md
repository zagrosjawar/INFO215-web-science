## Welcome to my INFO215-web-science GitHub repository!

Here you'll find my assignments, projects, and resources from the INFO215 course at the University of Bergen. Throughout the course, I gained extensive knowledge of Web Science, including web data crawling, analysis, and visualization using Python and libraries like Spacy, Django, and Scrapy.

I also explored exciting topics such as social web mining, utilizing APIs like GitHub and Wikipedia to extract valuable insights from web data. Join me on this web science journey as we unlock the power of the web and its vast potential.
