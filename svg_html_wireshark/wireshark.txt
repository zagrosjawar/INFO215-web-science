Pick a website you wish (for example www.google.com). Using ping utility (window/macOS) and wireshark find answer to the following questions:

1-Run <ping -n 5 www.yoursite.com> or <ping -c 5 www.yoursite.com> in your cmd/terminal while sniffing the network by wireshark.
2-What is the IP address of the website you pick?
3-How many packets have you captured overall and how many have you captured from this website?
4-What protocol does the ping utility use?
5-Using only wireshark, compute the RTT (Round Trip Time) – how long it took since your ping request was sent and until the ping reply was received?
6-How many TCP packets have your computer sent or received?

answers:
1. ping –c 5 www.wikipedia.org
2. ip address: 91.198.174.192
3. overall captured packet 3526,  from wikipedia IP address: 10
4. ping utility uses ICMP protocol
5. RTT: 0.034 ms
6. Number of TCP displayed:  1980 (56.2%)
