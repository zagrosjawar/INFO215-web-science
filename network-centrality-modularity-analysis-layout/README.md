# Network Centrality and Modularity Analysis

This program focuses on network centrality and modularity analysis using the NetworkX library. The details of the task are as follows:

## Task Description

1. Load a graph using the NetworkX library from the following CSV file: 'nutrients.csv'. The file can be accessed at [this link](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/26797/files/folder/code/L10?preview=3240723).

2. Measure centrality based on degree and eigenvector centrality using the NetworkX library.

3. Detect modularity of the graph using either label propagation or the Louvain method, both available in the NetworkX library.

4. Modify the size and color of nodes based on the centrality measures obtained in the previous step.

5. Visualize the graph using either the spring layout or the Fruchterman-Reingold layout.

## Code

in the python file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Community (part of the NetworkX library)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install networkx matplotlib python-louvain`.

2. Download the CSV file 'nutrients.csv' and save it in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

4. The program will load the graph from the CSV file and calculate the degree and eigenvector centrality measures.

5. It will then detect the modularity of the graph using either the label propagation or the Louvain method.

6. The size and color of nodes will be modified based on the centrality measures.

7.

 The graph will be visualized using either the spring layout or the Fruchterman-Reingold layout.

8. The resulting visualization will be displayed.

Note: You may need to adjust the parameters and settings according to your specific requirements.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code as needed for your own analysis.
